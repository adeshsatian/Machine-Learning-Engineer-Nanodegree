## I. Definition

### Project Overview
After the tax reform recently, articles and analysis about tax are everywhere. Working as a tax analyst, I conduct data analysis over financial data every day for tax purposes, but I still find it is a pain to fill out my own individual tax return every year. You might think we can use Turbo tax or other tax preparation software to get them done, but were you ever curious about the amount you paid compared to others. Did you pay more than others or less? How’s the tax payment distribution amount US like? There are also people who have income other than salary need to figure out how much estimated tax they should pay by the end of the year to avoid fines and penalties. 

US has a very complicated tax system that not everyone has time to fully understand. Errors might happen when people type in or write down the wrong amount, and no one wants to be audited or get penalties from IRS. There is no benchmark for people to estimate their tax, other than their previous year return. What should we do if this is the first year return? What should we do if our income structure changes completely? How to minimize the potential errors? IRS has the database of the tax information in US for the past several years. If we have a model that can predict roughly about how much tax we owe each year, we will be able to understand if we need to pay estimate tax or if there might be some potential errors. 

### Problem Statement
As discussed above, it is hard for each individual to understand how much tax they need to pay each year. People are vulnerable if they do not know if they need to pay an estimate tax or if they have paid the right amount. How to avoid these situations? The potential solution is to build up a model to estimate how much tax they should pay. In this way, there will be a benchmark for people to compare to so that they know if there are abnormal amount caused by errors or other factors.


### Metrics
There are many simple free models online, such as [smart assets]( https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes), that can be used as a benchmark. However, since similar models only take salary into account, the amount my model calculated could be different from them. We can use the real data from IRS to test the free model online and my model. The less difference between calculated amount and the real amount, the better the model is. This is more a regression model other than a classification model, so the percentage of differences can be a good measure.

## II. Analysis

### Data Exploration
In this section, you will be expected to analyze the data you are using for the problem. This data can either be in the form of a dataset (or datasets), input data (or input files), or even an environment. The type of data should be thoroughly described and, if possible, have basic statistics and information presented (such as discussion of input features or defining characteristics about the input or environment). Any abnormalities or interesting qualities about the data that may need to be addressed have been identified (such as features that need to be transformed or the possibility of outliers). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _If a dataset is present for this problem, have you thoroughly discussed certain features about the dataset? Has a data sample been provided to the reader?_
- _If a dataset is present for this problem, are statistics about the dataset calculated and reported? Have any relevant results from this calculation been discussed?_
- _If a dataset is **not** present for this problem, has discussion been made about the input space or input data for your problem?_
- _Are there any abnormalities or characteristics about the input space or dataset that need to be addressed? (categorical variables, missing values, outliers, etc.)_

### Exploratory Visualization
In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that summarizes or extracts a relevant characteristic or feature about the data. The visualization should adequately support the data being used. Discuss why this visualization was chosen and how it is relevant. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you visualized a relevant characteristic or feature about the dataset or input data?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

### Algorithms and Techniques
In this section, you will need to discuss the algorithms and techniques you intend to use for solving the problem. You should justify the use of each one based on the characteristics of the problem and the problem domain. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the algorithms you will use, including any default variables/parameters in the project clearly defined?_
- _Are the techniques to be used thoroughly discussed and justified?_
- _Is it made clear how the input data or datasets will be handled by the algorithms and techniques chosen?_

### Benchmark
In this section, you will need to provide a clearly defined benchmark result or threshold for comparing across performances obtained by your solution. The reasoning behind the benchmark (in the case where it is not an established result) should be discussed. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has some result or value been provided that acts as a benchmark for measuring performance?_
- _Is it clear how this result or value was obtained (whether by data or by hypothesis)?_


## III. Methodology
_(approx. 3-5 pages)_

### Data Preprocessing
In this section, all of your preprocessing steps will need to be clearly documented, if any were necessary. From the previous section, any of the abnormalities or characteristics that you identified about the dataset will be addressed and corrected here. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _If the algorithms chosen require preprocessing steps like feature selection or feature transformations, have they been properly documented?_
- _Based on the **Data Exploration** section, if there were abnormalities or characteristics that needed to be addressed, have they been properly corrected?_
- _If no preprocessing is needed, has it been made clear why?_

### Implementation
In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?_
- _Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?_
- _Was there any part of the coding process (e.g., writing complicated functions) that should be documented?_

### Refinement
In this section, you will need to discuss the process of improvement you made upon the algorithms and techniques you used in your implementation. For example, adjusting parameters for certain models to acquire improved solutions would fall under the refinement category. Your initial and final solutions should be reported, as well as any significant intermediate results as necessary. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has an initial solution been found and clearly reported?_
- _Is the process of improvement clearly documented, such as what techniques were used?_
- _Are intermediate and final solutions clearly reported as the process is improved?_


## IV. Results
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Model Evaluation and Validation
In this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the model’s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?_
- _Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?_
- _Is the model robust enough for the problem? Do small perturbations (changes) in training data or the input space greatly affect the results?_
- _Can results found from the model be trusted?_

### Justification
In this section, your model’s final solution and its results should be compared to the benchmark you established earlier in the project using some type of statistical analysis. You should also justify whether these results and the solution are significant enough to have solved the problem posed in the project. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the final results found stronger than the benchmark result reported earlier?_
- _Have you thoroughly analyzed and discussed the final solution?_
- _Is the final solution significant enough to have solved the problem?_


## V. Conclusion
_(approx. 1-2 pages)_

### Free-Form Visualization
In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that emphasizes an important quality about the project. It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

### Reflection
In this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?_
- _Were there any interesting aspects of the project?_
- _Were there any difficult aspects of the project?_
- _Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?_

### Improvement
In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_
- _Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?_
- _If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?_
