# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree

> Machine learning represents a key evolution in the fields of computer science, data analysis, software engineering, and artificial intelligence.

## Introduction

Right after finishing [Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree](https://github.com/rachelfu/Udacity-DAND), I found myself fascinated by Machine Learning. I will keep exploring. [Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) contains 6 projects, from supervised machine learning to deep learning. I will share my work here, please feel free to fork it, and let you know how to improve these projects.

## Getting Started

This program will include various machine learning projects. 

* Titanic Survival Exploration (Foundation)
* Predict Boston Housing Prices (Foundation)
* Find Donors for CharityML (Supervised) 
* Create Customer Segments (Unsupervised)
* Train a Smartcab to Drive (Reinforcement)
* Dog Breed Classifier (Deep Learning)
* Capstone Project

I will also make some notes, which will all be saved in [Toolkits](https://github.com/rachelfu/Toolkit). 

### Prerequisites

Most of the projects will use [Python](https://www.python.org). You can download [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which contains most of the modules you will need.
