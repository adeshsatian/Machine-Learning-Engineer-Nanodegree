# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree

> Machine learning represents a key evolution in the fields of computer science, data analysis, software engineering, and artificial intelligence.

## Introduction

Right after finishing [Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree](https://github.com/rachelfu/Udacity-DAND), I found myself fascinated by Machine Learning. I will keep exploring. [Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) contains 6 projects, from supervised machine learning to deep learning. I will share my work here, please feel free to fork it, and let you know how to improve these projects.

## Getting Started

### Overview
This program will include various machine learning projects. 

* Titanic Survival Exploration (Foundation)
* Predict Boston Housing Prices (Foundation)
* Find Donors for CharityML (Supervised) 
* Create Customer Segments (Unsupervised)
* Train a Smartcab to Drive (Reinforcement)
* Dog Breed Classifier (Deep Learning)
* Capstone Project

I will also make some notes, which will all be saved in [Toolkits](https://github.com/rachelfu/Toolkit). 

### Prerequisites

These projects requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python modules installed:

* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)

You will also need to install and run [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you have not had Python installed yet, it is highly recommended to install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

If there are additional modules needed for each project, it will be explained in each README.md file.

## Running

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory and run one of the following commands:

```bash
jupyter notebook XXX.ipynb
```

or 

```bash
ipython notebook XXX.ipynb
```

If there are special instructions, they will be provided in the project folder.
